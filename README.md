# Natural Language Processing on Yelp Reviews

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is widely used technique that is about the interactions between human languages and computer. Voice recognition, natural language generation/understanding are subcategories of NLP. NLP requires a lot of preprocessing in prior to the analysis, since most of the real-world text data are not well-written. Typos, slangs, and coined words are abundant or duplicated data to computer, and it cannot consider the same words in different forms as the same words. Native speakers (humans) need to clean out the text data for computers to help learning the natural languages.

In this post, I will show you how to preprocess on the text data and extract some information from the data. I used yelp reviews which is available from http://www.yelp.com/dataset. I developed topic modeling from reviews on the businesses on Las Vegas Strip, and built recommendation system to find similar businesses.
